Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the app uses:

- The project is developed in [Unreal Engine™](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) by using the creation tools for game development. Unreal Engine is the world's most open and advanced real-time 3D creation tool for photoreal visuals and immersive experiences.
- It is written mainly in Blueprints and C++™. Blueprints are used throughout the project for a simpler and faster results.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) package which allows the app to have a structured collection of data.It is a relational database management system that is based on structured query language (SQL).
- All computer graphics are designed on [Blender™](https://www.blender.org/) as a 3D modeling software. Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used in major art departments.
