# AUSTVirtualCampus
Senior Project for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, by Mariam El Zaatari and Anis Zoghbi
Abstract

This report tackles one of the negative aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that we are facing today. There is no denying that the pandemic has posed many problems into our daily lives. The most important challenge to conquer is to continuously abide by the social isolation measures imposed by this disease. Although these social isolation measures have proven to be highly effective, many individuals across society are negatively affected by it. 

In fact, the lack of social interacting is directly related to an individual’s mental well-being. Since schools and universities have shut down globally, many students were deprived from any social interaction and struggled with their psychological well-being. As a consequence, students are facing a problem in finding the motivation to study and attend online sessions regularly.

We can face this problem by providing the student with a 100% virtual campus from their home. The "Virtual Campus" is an e-learning concept that simulates a real campus’ atmosphere, activities, and interactions. The student can attend virtual classes, meetings, and conferences. Moreover, different avatars would be available for each student to match his own preferences. Lastly, the student can enjoy interacting with other students and joining workgroups.

The project is developed in Unreal Engine™ by using the creation tools for game development. It is written mainly in Blueprints and C++™. Blueprints are used throughout the project for a simpler and faster results. MySQL™ will be used as the main database server on the client and server side. Lastly, all computer graphics are designed on Blender™ as a 3D modeling software.

The system was primarily designed to meet the needs of universities, but it is possible to adapt and scale to meet the requirements of different organizations. For example, any organization would be able to host its own virtual conferences, fairs, expos, and events.
